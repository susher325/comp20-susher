All aspects of this project have been implemented correctly, however, I am not super confident about all of my security findings because my partner's code already had a lot of security features built in. I collaborated on this assignment with Tess Cotter, Kate Roland, and Alex Caufield. In total, I spent about 6 hours on this project.
