All elements of the assignment were implemented correctly.


I did not collaborate with any other students or TA's while writing my code for this project. However, I did help Kate Roland and Tess Cotter when they were stuck with certain parts of the project. Additionally, I used the Haversine Javascript implementation from Stack Overflow, which can be found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.

I spent approximately a total of 7 hours on this assignment.
