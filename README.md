This repository includes a series of assignments I worked on as a student in COMP20: Web Programming during Spring 2018. My favorite assignent was "Captains Log" because I was able to build a common feature that I never thought I would have the knowledge to create myself. Although this course only scratched the surface of Web Programming, I feel like I have grown significantly since the beginning of the course. In addition to learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, API's, Node.js, Express, Servers, and more, I also gained a much better ability to problem solve on my own and use the resources available to me to answer my questions. I was required to do this at many points throughout the course, specifically to complete the Security assignment, something I kenw virtually nothing about, as well as during the responsive design lab, which was a topic that ha confused me when we learned aout it initially in class. Now that I've finished the course, I'm interested in learning more about how to use API'sto crete more dynamic and interesting websites and applications. Thanks for a great semester!
